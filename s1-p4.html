        <p class="main-text story-item"> I was at a family member’s baby shower - first family gathering in a while. Me
          and the other younger kids were in the garage away from the main party. We had some markers and drawing on a
          paper table cloth.

        <p class="main-text story-item"> I was talking to my brother until <a class="hidden-text" href="#">Aunt Mica</a>
          came in.</p>

        <p class="main-text story-item"> She came into the garage and sat down in a chair across from me. <a

            href="#">Her eyes looked werid. Was she even looking at me? </a> before asking what I was doing.</p>
        <p class="main-text story-item"> I told her I was good and was drawing.<a class="hidden-text" href="#">I
            don’t know why but I could feel the hair on the back of my neck raise. </a> </p>

            leaned down to tell my brother to get the other kids out of the room and go to Dad. I didn't know why at the
            time but things felt off. </a> </p>
        <p class="main-text story-item"> That set her off. <br> She started ranting about spirituality, death, and the
          afterlife. <br><a class="hidden-text" href="#">I can’t remember all that was said just that I was scared. </a>
