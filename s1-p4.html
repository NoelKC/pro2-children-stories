        <p class="main-text story-item"> I was at a family member’s baby shower - first family gathering in a while. Me
          and my brother were coloring some baby jokes along with some other kids in the garage away from the main party
        </p>

    <p class="main-text story-item"> She came into the garage and sat down in a chair across from me. <br><a
        class="hidden-text" href="#">She was stumbling</a> </p>
    <p class="main-text story-item"> She asked me how I was and what I was doing. <br><a class="hidden-text"

    <p class="main-text story-item"> I told her I was good and was drawing.<br><a class="hidden-text" href="#">I
        don’t know why but I could feel the hair on the back of my neck raise </a> </p>
    <p class="main-text story-item"> She asked what I was drawing. <br><a class="hidden-text" href="#">She didn’t
        seem all there </a> </p>

        told my brother to go to Dad
      </a> </p>
    <p class="main-text story-item"> That set her off. She started ranting about spirituality, death, and the
      afterlife. <br><a class="hidden-text" href="#">I can’t remember all that was said just that I was scared </a>
    </p>
    <p class="main-text story-item">She said that when I die I would become nothing. <br><a class="hidden-text"
