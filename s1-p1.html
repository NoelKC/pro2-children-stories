        <p class="main-text story-item">I had to make a family tree in school today. I have so much family that I asked
          Mom for help - her side of the family is the biggest. Mom has many siblings: <a class="hidden-text"
            href="#">Auntie Mica</a>, Auntie Marty, Auntie Nay, and Uncle Gilly. </p>

        <p class="main-text story-item"> I met almost all of them - but I have never heard of <a class="hidden-text"
            href="#">Mica</a>. When I asked who <a class="hidden-text" href="#">Mica</a> was Mom got quiet. </p>
        <a class="hidden-text" href="#">She told me that Mica was the oldest, mother of my three cousins, and she hasn't been seen in a long time. She didnâ€™t want to elaborate after that. </a>
        <p class="main-text story-item"> I was confused. <a class="hidden-text" href="#">How could you not see or talk your sibling in years? I hang out with my brother every day </a> <br> Mom seemed sad. We both didn't bring it up. </p>
